# SHIFT_CNN_hw_accelerator
Design and implementation of a customized FPGA/ASIC circuit to accelerate this operation could help us reduce computational-cost, latency, and power consumption at an acceptable trade-off of a minute reduction in accuracy. (4x reduction in power consumption, 2x reduction in no. of MAC operations, accuracy reduction of just 1%)
